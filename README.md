<h3> 1. Introduction </h3>
  <p>
    Remote repository can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/danny-cpp/Days_old">https://github.com/danny-cpp/Days_old</a></br></br>
    This program is intended to calculate the days since the date of birth of a person (days old). This program leverage pre-existing standard library Calendar (java.util.Calendar). To highlight the encapsulation aspect of the OOP methodology, everything that can be implemented will not be hard-code again, and those are implemented must not be tampered with.</br></br>
    To be considered a well-functioning product, it must handle error and exception well. 
  </p>
  
<h3> 2. Design </h3>
  <p>
    The program must have an effective range, meaning it must be designed on a specific domain:
  </p>
  <ul>  
        <li> If the birth date is later than today date, it is invalid. </li>
        <li> If it is earlier than October 15, 1582; it is not supported. Since we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a>. </li>
        <li> Invalid date is passed, it must either throw exception or recognize the error.
  </ul>
  <p>
    We have:</br>
    <i>Number of days old = Days left of birth year + Days between birth year and now + The day of this year</i></br></br>
    Details will be in the code itself
  </p>

<h3> 3. Instruction </h3>
  <p>
    Unzip the <i>CountDaysPackage.zip</i> and copy to your source location. Include: <br><br>
    >> import days_old.CountDays; <br>
    >> import days_old.evaluate_exceptions.*; <br><br>
    Package include usable class <strong>CountDays</strong> along with 2 methods:
     <ul>  
        <li> <strong>countingDays()</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>dateParser(String s)</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Create CountDays object via contructor:<br><br>
    <strong><i>>> CountDays data = new Countdays(Calendar start, Calendar end); </i></strong><br><br>
    Exception <i>EndDateExceedsBeginDateException</i> is thrown if <i>start</i> is earlier than <i>end</i>. Exception <i>BeginningDateExceedsLimit</i> is also thrown if <i>start</i> is earlier than October 15, 1582.
   
  </p>
  <p>
    Method <i><strong>countingDays</strong></i> will find the difference between the the dates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Method <i><strong>dateParser(String s)</strong></i> will parse a string under the format "yyyy-MM-dd" to as <i>Calendar object</i><br><br>
    Exception InvalidDate will be thrown if the date does not exist (e.g. 1999-02-29, 2000-11-31)
  </p>
  
<h3> 4. Implementation </h3>
  <p>
    <i>DaysOld.java</i> is the implementation of the <i>CountDays</i> class. Method <i><strong>days(String s)</strong></i> will evaluate the days difference
    between that date and today (by calling Java API). All exceptions are handled. Method returns void, but will print out report via
    console.
  </p>
  
<h3> 5. Acknowledgement </h3>
  <p>
    This package implemented the <i>Calendar class</i> (java.util.Calendar).
